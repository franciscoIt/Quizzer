Quizz app that handles specific file formats.
If you seeing this repo means that I'm currently preparing for test and using the Streamlit free tier.
There is more value in the files to load than in the code.
If you are also preparing for a test, feel free to contact me, maybe you can use this repo to learn a thing or two :)
