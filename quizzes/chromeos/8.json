Ensure the identity provider is using an SAML compliant connection\nHere's why:\nSAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is the protocol: This is the standard that allows the 3rd party IdP to communicate authentication and authorization data to Google (the Service Provider in this case). If the SAML assertion sent by the IdP is malformed, missing required attributes (like NameID), incorrectly signed, or if the endpoints are misconfigured, Google will not be able to process the sign-in attempt and will show an error. \"Unable to sign in to Google\" often points to Google receiving an assertion but being unable to validate or understand it."}],"answer_description":"","timestamp":"2025-04-04 22:14:00","isMC":true,"question_images":[],"choices":{"C":"Disable the SSO connection in the Google Admin console","A":"Ensure the identity provider is using an SAML compliant connection","B":"Check Multi-Factor Authentication for the user account in the Google Admin console","D":"Apply the SSO certificate to the ChromeOS device"},"exam_id":4,"question_id":40,"url":"https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/238388-exam-professional-chromeos-administrator-topic-1-question-51/","topic":"1","unix_timestamp":1743797640,"question_text":"You have been tasked with selecting a 3rd party IdP to allow logging into ChromeOS devices.
