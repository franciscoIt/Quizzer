The best practice involves:\n\nConfiguring a hostname allowlist – This ensures that critical ChromeOS services (such as system updates and device policies) are not blocked or broken by SSL inspection.\nSetting up a TLS/SSL certificate – You must deploy a trusted root CA certificate to all managed ChromeOS devices via the Google Admin console. This allows devices to trust the SSL/TLS inspection process.\nVerifying TLS/SSL inspection – Test web filtering and SSL interception to confirm that the policies work without breaking key ChromeOS functionalities.","poster":"serialx86","upvote_count":"1","comment_id":"1356105"}],"choices":{"C":"Configure a transparent proxy set up your allowlist to use *.google.com, then verify TLS (or SSL) inspection is working.","D":"ChromeOS devices are preconfigured to adhere to company TLS (or SSL) inspection by default and can therefore be deployed with no additional configuration.","B":"Reach out to Google Workspace Security and Compliance for tailored configurations for your customer.","A":"Configure a hostname allowlist, set up a TLS (or SSL) certificate, then verify TLS (or SSL) inspection is working."}},{"id":"oCO2VTs4NKbwgXZ7n6aI","answer_description":"","choices":{"C":"Use a third-party recording tool to monitor the site","D":"Pin the site as an application","B":"Lock the browser in full screen","A":"Deploy the website as a kiosk app"},"timestamp":"2025-07-14 04:07:00","unix_timestamp":1752458820,"question_text":"A school district has a new exam provider.
