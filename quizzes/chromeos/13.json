Deprovision the ChromeOS device\n\nExplanation:\nTo ensure the device is rendered inoperable while still maintaining management over the device in the Admin console, you should deprovision the device.\n\nWhen you deprovision a ChromeOS device, it effectively removes it from your domain and renders it unusable. The device will be wiped of all enterprise data, policies, and configurations. This ensures that the device can't be used to access any company resources. However, it does not physically destroy the device or remove it from the Admin console immediately; it just prevents it from being used in your organization's environment.","comment_id":"1331308"}],"answer_images":[],"question_id":61,"question_text":"The security department has been informed that a ChromeOS device was stolen out of an employee’s car.
